## Build a Behance UI/UX/Web project

I have created this project to practice UI build. I looked for a nice web design on Behance and built it using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> and added small effects.

### How to open the project:
- in VS code right click on the index.html and choose Open with live server

You find the original design on the following link:
